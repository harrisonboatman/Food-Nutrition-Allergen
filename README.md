## Development

After discussing what would be useful when making a recipe searching website, we thought about how often people are allergic to some of the most common ingredients used in many recipes. Therefore, we looked to devise a website that will automatically alert the user to any sort of allergen that is noted in the ingredients of the resulting recipe. We used two different API's for this program, which pull in recipes, and then nutrition facts for said recipes.
